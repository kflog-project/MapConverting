/**
 * Polygon topology.
 *
 * <p>This class represents an actual polygon, a collection of lines
 * each of which completely encloses an area.  Each of the lines is
 * called a contour: the first contour is always the outside ring of
 * the polygon, and the remaining contours always represent holes inside
 * it (such as a park in a city or an island in a lake).</p>
 *
 * <p>The implementation is lazy: getting a polygon from a feature doesn't
 * actually cause the (very large) FBR, RNG, or FAC tables to be read
 * until you actually need them.</p>
 *
 * <p>In VPF terminology, a polygon is called a "face", abbreviated
 * "fac".</p>
