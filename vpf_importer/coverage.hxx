/**
 * A coverage in a library in a VPF database.
 *
 * <p>This is the third level of the VPF hierarchy: every database
 * contains one or move libraries, and every library contains one or
 * more coverages, collections of GIS data belonging to the same
 * general class (i.e. transportation) and sharing the same attribute
 * dictionary.  This class has a copy constructor, so it can
 * safely be assigned and passed around by value.</p>
 *
 * <p>All of the points, lines, and polygons for the coverage are
 * available through this class; however, if the coverage contains
 * multiple features, it will often be simpler to access the points,
 * lines, and polygons through each feature individually.</p>
 *
 * <p>Users should obtain a copy of the coverage object through the
 * library's getCoverage methods; new coverage objects cannot be
 * created directly (except by copying an existing one).</p>
