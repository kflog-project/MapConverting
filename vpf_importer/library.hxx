 * A library in a VPF database.

 * <p>This is the second level of the VPF hierarchy: every
 * database consists of one or more libraries, collections of related
 * coverages in the same area (i.e. North America, or southern
 * Ontario).  This class has a copy constructor, so it can safely be
 * assigned and passed around by value.</p>
 *
 * <p>Users should obtain a copy of the library object through the
 * database's getLibrary methods; new library objects cannot be
 * created directly (except by copying an existing one).</p>
